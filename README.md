# Airport Management Project in C++ with Data Handling
This project implements an airport management system in C++ using Dev-C++ as the development environment. It allows users to manage flight details, passenger information, worker details, and airport specifics through a console-based interface.

# Features
-Flight Management: Add, edit, and view flight details such as flight number, destination, departure time, etc.
-Passenger Management: Manage passenger details including name, age, ticket number, etc.
-Worker Management: Handle worker information such as name, role, contact details, etc.
-Airport Details: Maintain general airport information like name, location, contact details, etc.

# Development Environment
This project is developed using Dev-C++, a lightweight and efficient IDE for C/C++ programming. Make sure to have Dev-C++ installed to compile and run the project.

# File Structure
-main.cpp: Contains the main program logic and handles user interaction through console input and output.
-flight.txt: Stores flight details.
-passenger.txt: Stores passenger details.
-worker.txt: Stores worker details.
-airport.txt: Stores airport details.

# Usage
-Setup: Open the project in Dev-C++.
-Compilation: Compile the program by selecting Compile & Run or Build options in Dev-C++.
-Execution: Run the compiled executable within the Dev-C++ environment or from the command line.

# User Interface
-Use the console interface to navigate through different functionalities:
Enter corresponding options to add, modify, and view information for flights, passengers, workers, and airport details.
Follow on-screen prompts for data entry and modification.

# Data Handling
-File Storage: Data entered through the console interface is stored in text files (flight.txt, passenger.txt, worker.txt, airport.txt) for persistence.
-Reading and Writing: The program reads data from these files on startup and updates them as changes are made through the console interface.

# Additional Notes
-Ensure all inputs are validated to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.
-Detailed comments and documentation within the code should guide further development and maintenance.

# Future Enhancements
-Implement error handling and input validation to improve reliability.
-Enhance user interface for better usability and clarity.
-Add search, delete, and filtering functionalities for flights, passengers, workers, and airport details.
